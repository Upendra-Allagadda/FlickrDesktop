This application needs Flickr API key. 
The APIs of flickr might need an API key to be created. I request the you to
sign up for a free account at https://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html and use
the free account only.

After the API key is generated, get this project, navigate to ViewModels folder. Open PhotoFeedViewPageModel and paste/assign the value to API string in the Fields region.
